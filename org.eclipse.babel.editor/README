This project code is far from being mature: it is in early stage of a rewrite.

The code will be cleaned-up before labelling it as "stable".

Rather than being a straight port of the SourceForge project coming from...

http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-rbe

... the code actually comes from a rewrite of it that was already in progress.   

As such it is not nearly as stable or complete yet as the one on SourceForge.
 One can refer to the original SourceForge "ResourceBundle Editor" plugin to get
 a better feel for it until this one gets fixed/completed.

It is heavily being worked on and far from being "clean" code yet.  It was
put in CVS at this stage so people can see it in action and monitor progress.

Once as mature as its SourceForge equivalent, the API will likely have changed
quite a bit.
