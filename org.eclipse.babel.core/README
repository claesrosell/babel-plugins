This project code is pretty stable but its "API" is not.  Rather than being 
a straight port of the SourceForge project coming from...

http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-rbe

... the code actually comes from a rewrite of it that was already in progress.   

As such it is not nearly as stable or complete yet as the one on SourceForge.
 One can refer to the original SourceForge "ResourceBundle Editor" plugin to get
 a better feel for it until this one gets fixed/completed.

Some key concepts will likely change now that it is contributed to Eclipse.

This "core" will be updated to have tighter integration with Eclipse (its intent
previously was to be IDE agnostic).

Before you start contributing to this project, please ask what is coming down
the pipe as a lot of code already exist, just not ported over.
